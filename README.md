A mexican entrepreneur is requesting a social network where people who like to travel can join. Mex I can Travel is a mobile social network where people can meet new friends with the same interests, they can also have cool tips to help them when they travel. There are  two categories:
* **The Backpacker**, the user who likes to travel as much as likes to save money. They like to go to the markets and eat the traditional food of the different mexican states without spending a lot of money. Their ideal hotel is not a five stars hotel, but a clean and cheap one. 
* **The Tourist**, the user who doesn't mind to spend a little bit more as much as he/she is comfortable. They don't like to have surprises when they travel, they like to plan all the activities and all the meals during their trip. 

### OBJECTIVE:

How many times have we heard  "*I don't travel because I don't have money*"?
